"covector": patch
---

Update `init` to only use simple string based commands. These are easier to grok for users first starting with covector and looking to understand what the `init` has created. Also prefer the `pkgFile` based names in the publish step to make it easier for someone to switch to using nicknames for packages easier (and less foot-guns).
