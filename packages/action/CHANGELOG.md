- [`2db4d6e`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/2db4d6edc661442612a390a375b6bab7853c0968) ([#309](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/309) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) The GitHub comment was previously rather terse. We are now including the sha within the comment so as to make it clear when the command last ran.

## \[0.7.0]

- The action created a release for any `publish` keys in `pkgManger`, but didn't do it for anything specified in `packages`. This meant that if you elected not to use `pkgManager`, it would not create a release. This has been fixed and it will now create a release. We also added some debug output to improve the debugging experience.

## \[0.5.0]

- Adjust output from assemble and covector to expose the template that is piped into each command. This allows us to set it as an output in the github action.

## \[0.4.2]

- Pipe the previous command output into function commands. This is primarily for the Github Releases which injects functions and will need the changelog output from `pkgCommandsRan`.
  - [66539a8](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/66539a800365ccfb28f95291b066e77114863382) fix: GitHub release pipe ([#164](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/164)) on 2021-03-24

## \[0.4.1]

- The action `dist` folder was accidentally gitignored. We want to commit it so actions can run directly from the dist without install.
  - [ac2f857](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/ac2f857403fe970fec04c29d19ec199acf97ac65) chore: fix gitignore for action ([#160](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/160)) on 2021-03-18

- Bump effection to stable v1.
  - [29f9734](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/29f9734b9703c473b85608fce617ff61c5ef091c) fix: piped commands ([#159](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/159)) on 2021-03-17

## \[0.3.4]

- Fix `init` Rust based packages coming in as undefined.
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [1b8eca7](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/1b8eca7267a2d39549e8937c2e02279e27ab8824) fix: rust based packages undefined ([#151](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/151)) on 2021-02-22

## \[0.3.3]

- The result of the action had the covector output scoped, and further on logs failed. Hoist it so it is in the correct scope.
  - [e0ceae9](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/e0ceae980cafc3dcfdb6d4db4b2deb6c8e4c3a9b) fix: action output result undefined ([#145](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/145)) on 2021-02-14

## \[0.3.2]

- The `core` method was not passed to the release util in the Github Action. This failed the Github Release creation.

## \[0.3.1]

- Switch to currying github context as binding returned undefined.
  - [5b60ba1](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/5b60ba11b4c1169953da5c2a709ad15a9c700605) fix: curry github release info ([#141](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/141)) on 2021-02-14

## \[0.3.0]

- Add extra outputs for which packages published and a list of packages. This is useful for chaining runs of the action together.
  - [7d3b0d6](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/7d3b0d66d5ae1e826595535904513656a41cfac0) feat: add action output to better show which packages published ([#130](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/130)) on 2020-11-26
- Some workflows require different actions for different packages. Most of this can be codified into config. However there are cases where you may need to run a command for a dynamic set of packages.
  - [2748d90](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/2748d90cfe2dbe94050ccc85e932aff4260627d4) feat: filter pkgs ([#128](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/128)) on 2020-11-26
- Add `modifyConfig` property that takes a function which can modify the config file that is loaded. This will likely only be used in the Github Action to inject a JavaScript function into the publish sequences which creates a Github Release.
  - [6dc90bf](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/6dc90bfe849c4c9441afce7a26a01aabf4a2196c) feat: reorder GitHub release step ([#136](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/136)) on 2021-02-09

  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [095fe43](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/095fe43d856ff5cf22995d2729afa449ebc3d4e3) fix: proper pipe publish output in action ([#114](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/114)) on 2020-07-21

## \[0.2.5]

- Add extra outputs that says which command was run (for `version-or-publish`) and if something was published.
  - [65aad0f](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/65aad0f34ccc3d3b17ce31dda5eb9aaa8efd563f) feat: adjust action output for better follow on step responses ([#111](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/111)) on 2020-07-19

  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [a80e2ee](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/a80e2eecdc21318b9dd93e9a9fe2a5441703fea5) chore: increase default timeout ([#106](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/106)) on 2020-07-17

## \[0.2.3]

Bumped due to dependency.

## \[0.2.3]

- Fix create release and upload errors on publish.
  - [f0443c1](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/f0443c17e4584b026eecc6c8a5f34b362c02c498) fix: create release on publish ([#100](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/100)) on 2020-07-14

## \[0.2.2]

Bumped due to dependency.

## \[0.2.2]

- In --dry-run mode, output the expected commands with data piped in.
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [1bb67ea](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/1bb67ea671b6fbe9b21af9feb72612d166fd7662) fix: missing publish pipe ([#94](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/94)) on 2020-07-10

## \[0.2.1]

- Shift getPublishedVersion check prior to commands running. Without this, postpublished would never run (since packages were just published and are update to date).
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [922d224](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/922d224c34a4e3e2f711877fe42fddd4faba55ab) fix: getPublishedVersion check shift ([#92](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/92)) on 2020-07-10

## \[0.2.0]

- Added new dryRunCommand to specify a different command to run instead in --dry-run mode instead of skipping the specified command.
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [3ca050c](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/3ca050c2c51821d229209e18391535c266b6b200) feat: advanced commands ([#71](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/71)) on 2020-07-06
- Change files were being deleted too quickly for git info to be retrieved. Shift to end of sequence.
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [85bff4b](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/85bff4b146d59a5bc4a093f3e7610d22876d7d0e) fix: delay change file deletion for git info retrieval ([#82](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/82)) on 2020-07-09
- Pull and set git meta information on change files as an array of commits. This can then be piped into changelogs.
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [cc19486](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/cc19486f86b78aec2c719e5dd17a2d72cbc8d450) feat: new command package and piped git info ([#78](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/78)) on 2020-07-09
  - [de3248d](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/de3248dfd70146392ff65e7065c2125daf527728) feat: dep bump note in changelog ([#87](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/87)) on 2020-07-10
- Allow complex commands specified as an object. This let's one specify a dryRunCommand that is executed in --dry-run mode instead (so no accidental publishes!) or to set pipe to true that the output is returned from the main covector function. The pipe likely won't be used directly, but can be consumed within the action to create a Github Release, etc.
