# Covector Github Action

To use, add this action to your github workflow.

```yml
- name: covector version or publish
  uses: jbolda/covector/packages/action@covector-v0
  id: covector
  with:
    command: "version-or-publish"
```

## Inputs

See the [action.yml](./action.yml) for inputs to specify or see below.

| input          | description                                                        | required |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| command        | covector cli command to run                                        | true     |
| token          | Github Token or PAT for creating releases / posting messages       | false    |
| cwd            | The directory to run covector within, defaults to `process.cwd()`. | false    |
| createRelease  | Opt-in to create a release on publish                              | false    |
| draftRelease   | When creating a release, set it as a draft.                        | false    |
| filterPackages | A comma separated list (no spaces) of packages to run commands on. | false    |
| label          | "the Github pull request label that triggers preview packages"     | false    |
| previewVersion | Template for how the preview packages should be versioned          | false    |
| identifier     | Identifier for prerelease version template                         | false    |

Note that command can also use `version-or-publish` which is an input command unique to this action. It will dynamically determine if it needs to run `version` or `publish`. If there are no changes, we assume that `version` was run last, and the changes were deleted. With that assumption, we run `publish` if there are `No changes.` and `version` if there are changes.

## Outputs

See the [action.yml](./action.yml) for outputs for your use or see below.

| output            | description                                                                                             | command                           |

| releaseUrl        | The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release.                                             | publish                           |
| releaseUploadUrl  | The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses. | publish                           |

Besides these static outputs, we also supply dynamic outputs for each of your packages. Replace the `*` with your package name. Note, this will not be listed in the [action.yml](./action.yml). Outputs can only alphanumeric characters, and are replaced with a dash: `-`. For example, a scoped npm package of `@covector/awesome` would be `willPublish--covector-awesome`.

| output         | description                                                                      | command |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| published-\*   | Will be set as `"true"` (stringified boolean) if the package has been published. | publish |
| willPublish-\* | Will be set as `"true"` (stringified boolean) if the package will be published.  | status  |
| version-\*     | The current version number .                                                     | status  |

Outputs will generally be specified in the [action.yml](./action.yml), but since these are dynamic, it is not possible. See the [docs noting this is an optional required](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#outputs).

> If you don't declare an output in your action metadata file, you can still set outputs and use them in a workflow.
