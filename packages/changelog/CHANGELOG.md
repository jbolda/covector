# Changelog

## [0.1.0]

-   Add option to execute commands in "--dry-run" mode which will output the anticipated commands without running them and additional relevant information (such as the command pipe).
-   Skip over packages without a path. This let's us create "virtual packages" and configure a package such as "all" that let's us easily bump everything.

## [0.0.3]

Bumped due to dependency.

## [0.0.2]

-   We missed files in the changelog deps array so they diverged when bumped.
