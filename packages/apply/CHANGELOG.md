# Changelog

## \[0.10.0]

### Enhancements

- [`e2c83dc`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/e2c83dc5e98b9d8ddbf428af2dda32168e4df9ec) ([#318](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/318) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) Add `exports` to `package.json` for improved capability and an enhanced experience when developed covector and testing locally.
- [`ce43ad7`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/ce43ad7fd924319b544b30785217070436182d71) ([#319](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/319) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) Add logger instance to allow custom loggers based on the usage context. It enables different structured logs for the CLI vs within a GitHub Action, as well as for local development and testing.

### Dependencies

- Upgraded to `@covector/files@0.8.0`

### Changes Supporting Covector Development

- [`ce43ad7`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/ce43ad7fd924319b544b30785217070436182d71) ([#319](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/319) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) Switch to Vitest for the test runner. This improves speed and enables improved ability to update to current standards. Additionally, we use `pino-test` with the changes to the logger to more specifically check log output. Along with this, we switch multiple test fixtures to run commands that would return more standard output across OS which reduces test flakiness.

## \[0.9.3]

- [`9e111fc`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/9e111fcf2431690b8719ca493e6580a42e72c457) ([#304](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/304) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) Add currentVersion property to more easily refer to the version before a bump.
- [`9480736`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/9480736961fb92b1861938015b1be3fd53ee5355) ([#299](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/299) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) Allow running status command without logging. This allows the command to also serve more utilitarian purposes as well.

## \[0.7.0]

- The dependency bumps will now use the next version of the package as derived from the existing change files. Previously, it presumed that a applying a dependency bump was sufficient which worked most of the time, but ignored some edge cases.
  - [aa7ea83](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/aa7ea83b1463219643cb3098cc6bb7f5c6458374) dep bumps use main version directly vs presuming increment is correct ([#256](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/256)) on 2022-12-27
- Update multiple devDeps, semver, yargs, inquirer, and packages in our action. This is primarily internal upgrades and don't affect external APIs.
  - [18ff898](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/18ff898a64a0f3677c55d994d22177189700204a) dep update ([#240](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/240)) on 2022-04-16
- Apply parent bumps dependent on the how the dependency is specified. For a range bump, we don't assume that that requires a bump from a child. If a bump is expected, then a change file specific to the change is more explicit.
  - [ba6e7f1](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/ba6e7f1c9ead622844ff1c040fffb67b925f0bcf) skip bump for range ([#257](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/257)) on 2023-01-12
- This fixes the bug where we would look the range requirement on dependencies.
  - [763ee33](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/763ee33420f88a58161013b3cb7d3eea5ababea8) feat: keep dependency version requirement ([#252](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/252)) on 2022-12-21
- Remove the `to-vfile` package as a dependency. This allows us to focus our file reference to our specific needs, and one less dependency to maintain. With this change, we also converted a handful of promises into generators for better compatibility and control with effection.
  - [1b33933](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/1b33933be25094900f647527a82ddba0a08778fe) Remove vfile ([#234](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/234)) on 2022-04-10
- Upgrade to `effection` v2. This is primarily an internal improvement, but will enable future features such as fetching from an endpoint to check if a version of a package was published. It also brings an updated dependency to gracefully shutdown windows processes.
  - [a0acf81](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/a0acf81b2235ac142233d9c0e416d5e07af3cbb3) Effection v2 ([#227](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/227)) on 2022-03-19
  - [a346221](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/a346221102075e647693851fd1019d66641f8014) bump effection to latest on v2 ([#246](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/246)) on 2022-10-26

## \[0.6.0]

- Preview version template overwrites the prerelease identifier
  - [b6e21bc](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/b6e21bc1267fa7a09fb5311f2944e32385f2fbb4) Preveiw versioning for packages in prerelease mode ([#217](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/217)) on 2021-07-08

## \[0.5.0]

- Extract out types into separate package to remove issues with circular dependencies.
  - [519da36](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/519da362eff5628901a1f640120d39dd8234fdda) chore: set paths / references for TS and add types package ([#213](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/213)) on 2021-06-26

## \[0.4.0]

- Abstract out the file switches so `@covector/files` is the only package that considers file extensions.
  - [136d534](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/136d5347b09361e70c3bbd9773973938295fa9ac) feat: normalize version number pulling and setting ([#206](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/206)) on 2021-05-17
- Apply accepts a `prereleaseIdentifier` used to increment a prerelease version number.
  - [e388cc7](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/e388cc7ee98080e33744898737635711f3f30987) feat: prerelease mode and publishing ([#180](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/180)) on 2021-05-13
- Implement `errorOnVersionRange` which allows one to set a range which, when satisfied, will fail a `covector status` or `covector version`. This guardrail can help prevent a package from accidentally being bumped to the next major version.
  - [e388cc7](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/e388cc7ee98080e33744898737635711f3f30987) feat: prerelease mode and publishing ([#180](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/180)) on 2021-05-13
- This switches to using Typescript project references to build (previously rollup). It should affect the underlying packages or use.

  - [60e8fc7](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/60e8fc79cef13f2a2b442d772db0d9b8b9695ceb) chore: bump devDeps and fix tsconfig/rollup issues ([#165](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/165)) on 2021-03-24

## \[0.3.0]

- Convert covector to typescript.
  - [cf9a893](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/cf9a8935f244bd47b5614368865cc724f65e8980) feat: typescript covector main with rollup ([#63](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/63)) on 2020-07-02

  - [4437766](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/44377667fe7c64207bc84140fb4954b23dc4424f) feat: version bump guardrail ([#137](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/137)) on 2021-02-10

## \[0.2.1]

- Deep clone changes that are getting passed into the changelog. We were editing references and those edits were showing up in erroneous places.
  - [38fba3c](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/38fba3c6791154f335dde10740cde6ad556b6ef3) fix: deepclone change entries to prevent referencial edits ([#109](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/109)) on 2020-07-17

  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [3ca050c](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/3ca050c2c51821d229209e18391535c266b6b200) feat: advanced commands ([#71](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/71)) on 2020-07-06

## \[0.1.0]

- Add option to execute commands in "--dry-run" mode which will output the anticipated commands without running them and additional relevant information (such as the command pipe).
- Apply properly checks for parents to do dep bumps.
- Skip over packages without a path. This let's us create "virtual packages" and configure a package such as "all" that let's us easily bump everything.

## \[0.0.6]

- Package files should be referenced based on the "nickname" as noted in the config. The name in the package file is not a unique value.
