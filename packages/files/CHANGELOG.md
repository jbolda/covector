# Changelog

## \[0.5.0]

- Extract out types into separate package to remove issues with circular dependencies.
  - [519da36](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/519da362eff5628901a1f640120d39dd8234fdda) chore: set paths / references for TS and add types package ([#213](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/213)) on 2021-06-26

## \[0.4.0]

- Abstract out the file switches so `@covector/files` is the only package that considers file extensions.
  - [136d534](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/136d5347b09361e70c3bbd9773973938295fa9ac) feat: normalize version number pulling and setting ([#206](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/206)) on 2021-05-17
- Implement `errorOnVersionRange` which allows one to set a range which, when satisfied, will fail a `covector status` or `covector version`. This guardrail can help prevent a package from accidentally being bumped to the next major version.
  - [e388cc7](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/e388cc7ee98080e33744898737635711f3f30987) feat: prerelease mode and publishing ([#180](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/180)) on 2021-05-13
- This switches to using Typescript project references to build (previously rollup). It should affect the underlying packages or use.
