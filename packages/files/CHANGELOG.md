## \[0.6.0]

- Update multiple devDeps, semver, yargs, inquirer, and packages in our action. This is primarily internal upgrades and don't affect external APIs.
  - [18ff898](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/18ff898a64a0f3677c55d994d22177189700204a) dep update ([#240](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/240)) on 2022-04-16
- Bump inquirer and globby to highest CJS version.
  - [84eb245](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/84eb2451d0ad0c27c10caa9c516e5d9d61cf7ce0) bump inquirer and globby to highest CJS version ([#254](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/254)) on 2022-12-19
- Added a new function to read all of the package files and include their dependencies as an object for reference. This is helpful for further packages to understand if the dependency is range based and make judgements based on it.
  - [ba6e7f1](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/ba6e7f1c9ead622844ff1c040fffb67b925f0bcf) skip bump for range ([#257](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/257)) on 2023-01-12
- Remove the `to-vfile` package as a dependency. This allows us to focus our file reference to our specific needs, and one less dependency to maintain. With this change, we also converted a handful of promises into generators for better compatibility and control with effection.
  - [1b33933](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/1b33933be25094900f647527a82ddba0a08778fe) Remove vfile ([#234](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/234)) on 2022-04-10
- Upgrade to `effection` v2. This is primarily an internal improvement, but will enable future features such as fetching from an endpoint to check if a version of a package was published. It also brings an updated dependency to gracefully shutdown windows processes.
  - [a0acf81](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/a0acf81b2235ac142233d9c0e416d5e07af3cbb3) Effection v2 ([#227](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/227)) on 2022-03-19

- Implement `errorOnVersionRange` which allows one to set a range which, when satisfied, will fail a `covector status` or `covector version`. This guardrail can help prevent a package from accidentally being bumped to the next major version.
  - [e388cc7](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/e388cc7ee98080e33744898737635711f3f30987) feat: prerelease mode and publishing ([#180](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/180)) on 2021-05-13
