### Enhancements

- [`b0d3dc0`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/b0d3dc0fca525a5739a25f947b0d9b3b00dd49b1) ([#334](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/334) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) The `covector add` command now considers the `additionalBumpTypes` and `changeTags` configs and includes these in consideration of adding a change file.
- [`d0ad041`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/d0ad041b064bd99559a7fef52bb5e77b1a632756) ([#323](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/323) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) Bump actions within the covector init command to the latest: actions/checkout@v4 and peter-evans/create-pull-request@v6.
- [`e2c83dc`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/e2c83dc5e98b9d8ddbf428af2dda32168e4df9ec) ([#318](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/318) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) Add `exports` to `package.json` for improved capability and an enhanced experience when developed covector and testing locally.
- [`dda5430`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/dda5430e44d6dddc1946f13e5e4306a2d534e6ab) ([#337](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/337) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) When there are no changes, also include a link to create a new change file.
- [`c72c060`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/c72c060e7d14434d946d1a481a0cc6c8e67ed229) ([#316](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/316) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) Use node v20 in GitHub Action.
- [`ce43ad7`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/ce43ad7fd924319b544b30785217070436182d71) ([#319](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/319) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) Add logger instance to allow custom loggers based on the usage context. It enables different structured logs for the CLI vs within a GitHub Action, as well as for local development and testing.
- [`24cb7c1`](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/24cb7c1d00c7f06b908e1560db9016bc1a2c7d10) ([#335](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/335) by [@jbolda](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/../../jbolda)) Use clack instead of inquirer for handling user input. The user experience is improved and the dependencies are more slim. Additionally, switch `getPublishedVersion` to `fetch:check` which provides a cleaner version check for the npm and crates registries.

### Dependencies

  - [78222c4](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/78222c47dcee04a8478d0e4abddb499b5eb95f74) bump @effection/node for node@16 windows support ([#210](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/210)) on 2021-05-28
- Implement `errorOnVersionRange` which allows one to set a range which, when satisfied, will fail a `covector status` or `covector version`. This guardrail can help prevent a package from accidentally being bumped to the next major version.
  - [e388cc7](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/e388cc7ee98080e33744898737635711f3f30987) feat: prerelease mode and publishing ([#180](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/180)) on 2021-05-13

- Update `init` to only use simple string based commands. These are easier to grok for users first starting with covector and looking to understand what the `init` has created. Also prefer the `pkgFile` based names in the publish step to make it easier for someone to switch to using nicknames for packages easier (and less foot-guns).
  - [5692f42](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/5692f42372528bc249a057d738059e34e3706b04) fix: improve init output for easier onboarding ([#178](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/178)) on 2021-04-14

- Pipe the previous command output into function commands. This is primarily for the Github Releases which injects functions and will need the changelog output from `pkgCommandsRan`.

- Split up config merge function into two functions, one for version and one for publish, et al. This makes the types easier to reason about.
  - [66539a8](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/66539a800365ccfb28f95291b066e77114863382) fix: GitHub release pipe ([#164](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/164)) on 2021-03-24

## \[0.5.1]

- The action `dist` folder was accidentally gitignored. We want to commit it so actions can run directly from the dist without install.
  - [ac2f857](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/ac2f857403fe970fec04c29d19ec199acf97ac65) chore: fix gitignore for action ([#160](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/160)) on 2021-03-18

## \[0.4.5]

- Fix `init` Rust based packages coming in as undefined.
  - [1b8eca7](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/1b8eca7267a2d39549e8937c2e02279e27ab8824) fix: rust based packages undefined ([#151](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/151)) on 2021-02-22

## \[0.4.4]

- The result of the action had the covector output scoped, and further on logs failed. Hoist it so it is in the correct scope.
  - [e0ceae9](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/e0ceae980cafc3dcfdb6d4db4b2deb6c8e4c3a9b) fix: action output result undefined ([#145](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/145)) on 2021-02-14

## \[0.4.3]

- The `core` method was not passed to the release util in the Github Action. This failed the Github Release creation.
  - [c9026bd](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/c9026bdc47d828b7f5c17b6e4680d22fe7c623a6) fix: core not passed in action ([#143](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/143)) on 2021-02-14

## \[0.4.2]

- Switch to currying github context as binding returned undefined.
  - [5b60ba1](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/5b60ba11b4c1169953da5c2a709ad15a9c700605) fix: curry github release info ([#141](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/141)) on 2021-02-14

## \[0.4.0]

- Some workflows require different actions for different packages. Most of this can be codified into config. However there are cases where you may need to run a command for a dynamic set of packages.
  - [2748d90](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/2748d90cfe2dbe94050ccc85e932aff4260627d4) feat: filter pkgs ([#128](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/128)) on 2020-11-26
- Add `init` command that helps to bootstrap the configuration.
  - [948ca7c](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/948ca7ca7f6332abb6ffd13ff68d21560f275b57) feat: init command ([#139](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/139)) on 2021-02-12
- Add `modifyConfig` property that takes a function which can modify the config file that is loaded. This will likely only be used in the Github Action to inject a JavaScript function into the publish sequences which creates a Github Release.
  - [6dc90bf](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/6dc90bfe849c4c9441afce7a26a01aabf4a2196c) feat: reorder GitHub release step ([#136](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/136)) on 2021-02-09
- Add a validation guardrail within the `status` command. This will run a nearly identical version application function. It can catch an error during the PR process rather than during the versioning process.
  - [4437766](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/44377667fe7c64207bc84140fb4954b23dc4424f) feat: version bump guardrail ([#137](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/137)) on 2021-02-10

## \[0.3.1]

- The command sequence was piping to the return correctly, but in publish, we didn't properly concat the text. Fix that.
  - [095fe43](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/095fe43d856ff5cf22995d2729afa449ebc3d4e3) fix: proper pipe publish output in action ([#114](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/114)) on 2020-07-21

## \[0.3.0]

- Allow multiple publish sequences. Any command beginning with `publish` will invoke the related `getPublishedVersion`, e.g. `publishNPM` would look for and check `getPublishedVersionNPM`. This allows separation of concerns and re-run-ability for multiple deploy targets.

## \[0.2.6]

- Increase default timeout and allow it to be set from config.
  - [a80e2ee](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/a80e2eecdc21318b9dd93e9a9fe2a5441703fea5) chore: increase default timeout ([#106](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/106)) on 2020-07-17

## \[0.2.5]

- Stringify remaining portion of change file. Previously we were just looping on `paragraph` which would miss links.
  - Bumped due to a bump in @covector/assemble.
  - [afc5ceb](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/afc5ceb747609979d82e380d7be086a40cdc48ef) fix: stringify remaining change file ([#103](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/103)) on 2020-07-15

## \[0.2.4]

- Throw an error if a change file is added that targets a package that does not exist in the config.
  - [48c1c99](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/48c1c995fd69b028ec975fc577986b23adfb55b9) feat: throw error on non-existant package, closes [#57](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/57) ([#102](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/102)) on 2020-07-14

## \[0.2.3]

- Pass split versions through to pipe.
  - Bumped due to a bump in @covector/assemble.
  - [6370826](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/63708261d633d22ada1c7e14667b4107ea7e68c3) fix: pass split versions through to pipe ([#96](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/96)) on 2020-07-11

## \[0.2.2]

- In --dry-run mode, output the expected commands with data piped in.
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [1bb67ea](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/1bb67ea671b6fbe9b21af9feb72612d166fd7662) fix: missing publish pipe ([#94](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/94)) on 2020-07-10

## \[0.2.1]

- Shift getPublishedVersion check prior to commands running. Without this, postpublished would never run (since packages were just published and are update to date).
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [922d224](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/922d224c34a4e3e2f711877fe42fddd4faba55ab) fix: getPublishedVersion check shift ([#92](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/92)) on 2020-07-10

## \[0.2.0]

- Added new dryRunCommand to specify a different command to run instead in --dry-run mode instead of skipping the specified command.
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [3ca050c](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/3ca050c2c51821d229209e18391535c266b6b200) feat: advanced commands ([#71](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/71)) on 2020-07-06
- Change files were being deleted too quickly for git info to be retrieved. Shift to end of sequence.
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [85bff4b](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/85bff4b146d59a5bc4a093f3e7610d22876d7d0e) fix: delay change file deletion for git info retrieval ([#82](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/82)) on 2020-07-09
- Pull and set git meta information on change files as an array of commits. This can then be piped into changelogs.
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.

- Allow complex commands specified as an object. This let's one specify a dryRunCommand that is executed in --dry-run mode instead (so no accidental publishes!) or to set pipe to true that the output is returned from the main covector function. The pipe likely won't be used directly, but can be consumed within the action to create a Github Release, etc.
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [3ca050c](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/3ca050c2c51821d229209e18391535c266b6b200) feat: advanced commands ([#71](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/71)) on 2020-07-06
- Version commands used to only run on changes, but ignore parents. Reconfigure that we resolve the parents and run commands on both direct changes and changes through a dependency.
  - Bumped due to a bump in covector.
  - [3ca050c](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/3ca050c2c51821d229209e18391535c266b6b200) feat: advanced commands ([#71](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/71)) on 2020-07-06

## \[0.1.1]

- We were missing a yield on getPublishedVersion which was meaning everything would always try to publish.

## \[0.1.0]

- Add option to execute commands in "--dry-run" mode which will output the anticipated commands without running them and additional relevant information (such as the command pipe).
- Allow use of any arbitrary command as defined in the configuration.
- Allow arrays for commands and run pre/post versions of each command.

## \[0.0.17]

- Temporarily switch to execa for covector as it properly deals with piped and errors.

## \[0.0.16]

Bumped due to dependency.

## \[0.0.15]

- Add ability to read and write changelogs.
