# Changelog

## [0.3.1]

-   The command sequence was piping to the return correctly, but in publish, we didn't properly concat the text. Fix that.
    -   [095fe43](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/095fe43d856ff5cf22995d2729afa449ebc3d4e3) fix: proper pipe publish output in action ([#114](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/114)) on 2020-07-21

## [0.3.0]

-   Allow multiple publish sequences. Any command beginning with `publish` will invoke the related `getPublishedVersion`, e.g. `publishNPM` would look for and check `getPublishedVersionNPM`. This allows separation of concerns and re-run-ability for multiple deploy targets.
    -   [ed3698d](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/ed3698df85140dd13e98569c4266df03f8bbfc16) feat: allow multiple publishes ([#113](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/113)) on 2020-07-19

## [0.2.6]

-   Increase default timeout and allow it to be set from config.
    -   [a80e2ee](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/a80e2eecdc21318b9dd93e9a9fe2a5441703fea5) chore: increase default timeout ([#106](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/106)) on 2020-07-17

## [0.2.5]

-   Stringify remaining portion of change file. Previously we were just looping on `paragraph` which would miss links.
    -   Bumped due to a bump in @covector/assemble.
    -   [afc5ceb](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/afc5ceb747609979d82e380d7be086a40cdc48ef) fix: stringify remaining change file ([#103](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/103)) on 2020-07-15

-   Throw an error if a change file is added that targets a package that does not exist in the config.

    -   [1bb67ea](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/1bb67ea671b6fbe9b21af9feb72612d166fd7662) fix: missing publish pipe ([#94](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/94)) on 2020-07-10

## [0.2.1]

-   Shift getPublishedVersion check prior to commands running. Without this, postpublished would never run (since packages were just published and are update to date).
    -   Bumped due to a bump in covector.
    -   [922d224](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/922d224c34a4e3e2f711877fe42fddd4faba55ab) fix: getPublishedVersion check shift ([#92](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/92)) on 2020-07-10

## [0.2.0]

-   Added new dryRunCommand to specify a different command to run instead in --dry-run mode instead of skipping the specified command.
    -   Bumped due to a bump in covector.
    -   [3ca050c](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/3ca050c2c51821d229209e18391535c266b6b200) feat: advanced commands ([#71](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/71)) on 2020-07-06
-   Change files were being deleted too quickly for git info to be retrieved. Shift to end of sequence.
    -   Bumped due to a bump in covector.
    -   [85bff4b](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/85bff4b146d59a5bc4a093f3e7610d22876d7d0e) fix: delay change file deletion for git info retrieval ([#82](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/82)) on 2020-07-09
-   Pull and set git meta information on change files as an array of commits. This can then be piped into changelogs.
    -   Bumped due to a bump in covector.
    -   [cc19486](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/cc19486f86b78aec2c719e5dd17a2d72cbc8d450) feat: new command package and piped git info ([#78](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/78)) on 2020-07-09
    -   [de3248d](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/de3248dfd70146392ff65e7065c2125daf527728) feat: dep bump note in changelog ([#87](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/87)) on 2020-07-10
-   Allow complex commands specified as an object. This let's one specify a dryRunCommand that is executed in --dry-run mode instead (so no accidental publishes!) or to set pipe to true that the output is returned from the main covector function. The pipe likely won't be used directly, but can be consumed within the action to create a Github Release, etc.
    -   Bumped due to a bump in covector.
    -   [3ca050c](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/3ca050c2c51821d229209e18391535c266b6b200) feat: advanced commands ([#71](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/71)) on 2020-07-06
-   Version commands used to only run on changes, but ignore parents. Reconfigure that we resolve the parents and run commands on both direct changes and changes through a dependency.
    -   Bumped due to a bump in covector.
    -   [3ca050c](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/3ca050c2c51821d229209e18391535c266b6b200) feat: advanced commands ([#71](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/71)) on 2020-07-06

    -   Bumped due to a bump in covector.

-   Split out child_process commands into separate package.
    -   Bumped due to a bump in covector.
    -   [cc19486](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/cc19486f86b78aec2c719e5dd17a2d72cbc8d450) feat: new command package and piped git info ([#78](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/78)) on 2020-07-09

## [0.1.1]

-   We were missing a yield on getPublishedVersion which was meaning everything would always try to publish.

## [0.1.0]

-   Add option to execute commands in "--dry-run" mode which will output the anticipated commands without running them and additional relevant information (such as the command pipe).
-   Allow use of any arbitrary command as defined in the configuration.
-   Allow arrays for commands and run pre/post versions of each command.

## [0.0.17]

-   Temporarily switch to execa for covector as it properly deals with piped and errors.

## [0.0.16]

Bumped due to dependency.

## [0.0.15]

-   Add ability to read and write changelogs.
