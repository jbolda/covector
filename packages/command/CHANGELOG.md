- Remove `execa` as the command runner. We still attempt to handle of some the backward compatibility that can eventually be deprecated (such as the pipe defaulting to using a shell), but it enables more control over how the runner executes commands (or fails the commands).
  - [691d81f](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/691d81f5d4990d3aeb5aa37d46b738e1a0e96601) effection for exec of shell ([#239](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/239)) on 2022-12-19
- The exported sh function returns an object instead of a string exposing more detailed information about the command.
  - [bf94c90](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/commit/bf94c905e05ea8402c596564eea1fa8bcb8d975b) undefined commits in changelog, `git log` needs to be run serially ([#261](https://www.github.com/jbolda/covector/pull/261)) on 2023-01-16
- Upgrade to `effection` v2. This is primarily an internal improvement, but will enable future features such as fetching from an endpoint to check if a version of a package was published. It also brings an updated dependency to gracefully shutdown windows processes.
